# Cursor Rules for Electrical Enterprise

## Deployment

When the user types "deploy" or asks to deploy, ALWAYS use the deployment script:
- Run: `npm run deploy` or `./scripts/deploy.sh`
- The script handles: build, commit, push, deploy Convex, deploy Vercel
- DO NOT deploy manually step-by-step - use the script
- The script is located at: `scripts/deploy.sh`

## Important Notes

- Always commit all changes before deploying
- The deployment script automatically handles commits and pushes
- Never skip the commit step
