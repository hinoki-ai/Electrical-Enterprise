# Convex Setup Instructions

Run these commands in your terminal (not through me):

1. Authenticate and set up Convex:
   npx convex dev

2. This will open your browser - sign in and create/select a project

3. Once authenticated, get your deployment URL:
   npx convex dashboard

4. Copy the URL from the dashboard (looks like https://your-project.convex.cloud)

5. Update .env.local with your URL:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud

6. Deploy your schema:
   npx convex deploy

7. Generate types:
   npx convex codegen

8. Start the app:
   npm run dev

Your Convex functions are ready:
- Quotes: createQuote, getAllQuotes, getQuoteWithDetails
- Line Items: addLineItem, addLineItemOption  
- Calculator: createSession, saveAsPreset

No authentication required - anonymous access for quotes!
